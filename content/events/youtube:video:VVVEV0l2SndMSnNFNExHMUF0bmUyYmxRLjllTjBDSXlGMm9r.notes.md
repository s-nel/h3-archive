* Ethan and Hila Klein were sued by [Matt Hosseinzadeh](/people/mhosseinzadeh), an American YouTuber, who claimed that they infringed upon his copyrights and also defamed him. Ultimately, the court deemed that Ethan and Hila’s video was criticism and commentary and would fall under fair use. Notably, the court also dismissed the defamation claim due to the fact that the statements made were “substantially true as a matter of law”. Therefore, the following statements about [Matt Hoss](/people/mhosseinzadeh) have been deemed by a court as substantially true as a matter of law: “The king of cringe-tube”, and a “Dang Goobus”. Interestingly, these are the only two negative comments that Ethan made during the entire video.
