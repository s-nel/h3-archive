Trisha Paytas is a YouTuber and Musician best known for her dramatic content and polarizing personality.

In 2019, Trisha was featured in an h3h3Productions video ["Instagram vs. Reality"](/events/youtube:video:VVVEV0l2SndMSnNFNExHMUF0bmUyYmxRLk9YX0JpbmkyOWtV) in which Ethan criticized Trisha for using filters to appear more beautiful. He also made jokes about Trisha's weight which started a beef between Trisha and Ethan.

Later in 2019 Trisha was a guest on the podcast, and Ethan apologized to Trisha for his comments in ["Instagram vs. Reality"](/events/youtube:video:VVVEV0l2SndMSnNFNExHMUF0bmUyYmxRLk9YX0JpbmkyOWtV).

In 2020, Trisha came back on the podcast and it was announced that she would be the BacH3lorette--a competition to find Trisha a boyfriend. As with [Ian](/people/islater)'s disruption of the 2019 BacH3lor, Trisha subverted the rules of the event and started dating [Moses Hacmon](/people/mhacmon), Hila's brother. Ethan and Hila initially disapproved of the relationship and many questioned the legitimacy of Trisha's feelings for [Moses](/people/mhacmon).

Later in 2020, Trisha and Ethan surprised fans by starting a new series together on the H3 Podcast channel, "Frenemies". The series was hugely popular and are some of the podcast's biggest episodes. During the course of the show, [Moses](/people/mhacmon) and Trisha get engaged. It also came to light that Trisha had been abusive to [Moses](/people/mhacmon). Although the series was successful, the chemistry between Ethan and Trisha was rocky, and during a few episodes Trisha called quits by storming off. Ethan and Trisha made up after each occasion, until [episode 39 of "Frenemies"](/events/spotify:episode:12zG7sv4cfyPRC3siijDQc) when Trisha quits the podcast for good.

Trisha and [Moses](/people/mhacmon) were married in December 2021, but due to the drama and the fallout of "Frenemies", the relationship between Trisha, [Moses](/people/mhacmon) and their families is strained. Ethan and Hila actively avoid bringing her up or saying her name and refer to her as "TP" instead.
