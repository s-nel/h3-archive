Félix Lengyel AKA xQc is one of the most-viewed Twitch streamers. Ethan first talked to xQc on [H3TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2_d3nvIy9Y&ab_channel=H3TVVODS) for a debate about gambling streams on Twitch. xQc was very agitated during the conversation and lashed out at Ethan. More recently xQc has been more positively received on the podcast due to his soundbites and Love's support of Félix.
