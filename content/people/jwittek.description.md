Jeff Wittek is a YouTuber known for being a part of [David Dobrik](/people/ddobrik)'s Vlog Squad and for his show "Jeff's Berbershop".

Jeff was a call-in guest on the podcast after the [Durte Dom](/people/dzeglaitis) Rape allegations came to light. During the call, Jeff
denied any involvement and the conversation was very heated. Some time after the podcast it was revealed that Jeff himself was the 
victim of a horrific accident at the hands of [David Dobrik](/people/ddobrik) which almost killed Jeff.

Despite the heated first interaction on the podcast, Ethan was supportive of Jeff and encouraged Jeff to sue [David](/people/jwittek).
Jeff came on the podcast a few more times to squash the beef and to co-host the 2022 Steamies award show with [Tana Mongeau](/people/tmongeau).
