Patrice Wilson is a music producer and music video director best known for his odd vanity music videos most notably podcast guest, [Rebecca Black](/people/rblack)'s song ["Friday"](https://youtu.be/kfVsfOSbJY0). He also produced Alison Gold's ["Chinese Food"](https://youtu.be/n49of3EbpR8) and ["ABCDEFG"](https://youtu.be/rv7htnDEbog) which were the subject of an h3h3Productions video<sup>[[1]](/events/youtube:video:VVVEV0l2SndMSnNFNExHMUF0bmUyYmxRLjRONmlNM3FiWU1N)</sup><sup>[[2]](/events/youtube:video:VVVEV0l2SndMSnNFNExHMUF0bmUyYmxRLkFyRXVnV3c1SVE4)</sup>.

In 2017, during a [podcast episode](/events/spotify:episode:0izTQLqfEAuYCyZs8uydYR) with guest and friend [Post Malone](/people/apost), Ethan showed a live countdown on Patrice's channel with an eerie video feed alternating between a curtain that was moving slightly, a POV shot of a person walking around a wooded area, and a graveyard. The countdown appeared to be linked to the H3 podcast or Ethan because the video's title ended with "h3h3". It was so eerie that Ethan and Hila did not stay in their home on the day when the countdown finished because they didn't feel safe. The whole stunt turned out to be a promotion for Patrice Wilson's music video that called out online bullying--like the bullying he believes he received from h3h3Productions videos.

In 2023, [Rebecca Black](/people/rblack) was a guest on the podcast, but she wasn't able to talk much about her relationship with Patrice or the legal disputes over her song, "Friday", but it was clear that there were issues between her and the production company over the rights to the viral song.
