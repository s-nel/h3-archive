Austin McBroom is a YouTuber and with his wife [Catherine Paiz](/people/cpaiz) run the family channel "The Ace Family". He's been criticized by the podcast for exploiting his children for content and for exploiting their fans for money.

Austin has organized several questionable events. In 2018 and 2019 he organized charity basketball games. The podcast criticized these events for donating very little to charity despite presumably making profit. 

In 2021 and 2022, Austin McBroom organized the boxing events "Social Gloves" and "Social Gloves 2". These events were criticized for not paying their fighters including TikTok star [Bryce Hall](/people/bhall) who still claims that McBroom owes him $5 million for the fight.

Austin and [Catherine](/people/cpaiz) entered a redemption arc with the podcast after the crew attended the McBrooms' "Ace Fest" and reported about it positively.
