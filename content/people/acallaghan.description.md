Andrew Callaghan is the brains behind the "Channel Five News" YouTube channel and formerly the "All Gas, No Breaks" channel. His "man on the street" style videos were featured in their entirety on the podcast on several episodes, and Andrew was a guest three times. In 2023, Andrew was effectively cancelled after several victims accused him of sexual pestering. Andrew made an apology and has since been on hiatus from making content.
