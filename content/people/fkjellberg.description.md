Felix Kjellberg AKA PewDiePie is one of the most subscribed YouTubers in the world and the first individual YouTuber to reach 100M subscribers on the platform. Felix was the second guest on the podcast. In 2017 [Ethan covered Felix dropping the N-word](/events/spotify:episode:1HGATihgIMWTRb5lGwcLKy) and drew controversy when he criticized Felix although he had said the word himself in [episode 4](/events/spotify:episode:3G8z7wlTANLYlB78n3ljYv) with Idubbz as a guest. Ethan addressed the controversy in [episode 30](/events/spotify:episode:3YRJUEWRupYfZeN6vJU5Tk) during which he defended his use of the N-word because he was quoting Idubbbz name and said the word several times during [episode 30](/events/spotify:episode:3YRJUEWRupYfZeN6vJU5Tk). All moments of Ethan saying the N-word have now been removed, and Ethan has disavowed white people using the word in any context.
