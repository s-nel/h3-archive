Elon Musk is the billionaire businessman who owns Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter. Early in the podcast, Elon was admired for his innovations with electric vehicles and self-driving. More recently, Elon is regarded as an immature egomaniac by many after he decided to become a republican and posts offensive, edgy, and cringy memes on Twitter. In 2022, Ethan was permanently banned from Twitter after he changed his profile picture and Twitter name to "Elon Musk" and started impersonating Musk, despite making it clear in his bio and cover photo that the account was a parody.
