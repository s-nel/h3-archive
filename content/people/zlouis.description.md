Zach joined the podcast in 2018. He unlocked a new side of the podcast by playing soundbites which earned him the nickname "the sound lad".

Zach gained popularity on the podcast for his loyalty to Ehtan and his willingness to do anything--notably letting [Big Ed](/people/brown) put 
mayonaise in his hair.

Today, Zach makes the podcast what it is through his incredible talent for playing the right soundbite at the right time.
