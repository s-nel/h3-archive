Dan is the first crewmember on the Podcast. Dan was hired to do live switching to avoid having to edit all the podcast episodes after recording.

After a while, Dan became more of an active voice on the podcast, and today the show wouldn't be the same without him. He now actively contributes
to the conversation every podcast and is known as Dan "The Hater" since he's comfortable openly disagreeing with or correcting Ethan.
