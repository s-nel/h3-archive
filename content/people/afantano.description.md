Anthony Fantano is a YouTuber and music critic who is widely known for his album reviews. In 2022, Anthony drew media attention when he provoked angry DMs from musician [Drake](/people/agraham) after Anthony reviewed [Drake](/people/agraham)'s new album, "Honestly, Nevermind". Instead of posting screenshots of the DMs, Fantano decided to troll Drake by making a video claiming that [Drake](/people/agraham) had shared a recipe for chocolate chip cookies. This video prompted [Drake](/people/agraham) to post a screenshot of the actual DMs on his Instagram. In the DMs, [Drake](/people/agraham) used phrases that revealed him to be at least a semi-regular viewer of Fantano's content.
